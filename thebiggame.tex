\chapter{The Big Game}

On Thursday 14th November I hired a car for four weeks; I need one to
get around and I'll be able to make a few trips to Canberra in it. I
busted at a Petersham \$120 No Limit Holdem Tournament and the next
day drove down to Canberra for another shot at the 5/5 PLO.

This is a game that will stay with me forever. I came armed with a ton
of cash; I took a huge \$6360 with me. No more ``bring \$1500 with a
\$1000 ATM rebuy option'' approach for me, I'm bringing a bazooka to a
gun fight.

The night was also memorable for the ``Code War'' boxing match between
the NRL's Paul Gallen and the AFL's Barry Hall. The fight, six rounds
of two minutes, was being shown at the Casino and there was a good
crowd in to watch the fight there.

I've got a hotel Friday 2pm till Saturday 10am and I can play Saturday
night also if I feel like it. Remember that Canberra poker only runs
7pm to 330am so to play Saturday night I have to hang around Canberra
during the day with no hotel and front up again at 630pm. It's hard
doing that when you could be driving back to Sydney at any time.

I left \$700 in emergency cash in my hotel room and took \$5660 with
me to the casino. I'd thought about making \$500 buyins but settled
for \$300 buyins. This was min-and-a-bit buyins, in the Star 1/3 PLO
games which have a buyin range of 100-300 I buy in for 150; so 300 is
the min-and-a-bit equivalent of a 200-2000 buyin range.

I lose my first buyin when KK finds a flop of AKQ two spades; I'm
behind on every street to JT. My second buyin, of \$320 just to use an
extra \$20 floating around in my wallet, doesn't last long either and
I'm dipping into my special 50x\$100 notes 5k rubber banded stash for
my third buyin.

The third buyin flops the world when my iffy 9s-6s-5-3s three-spades gets a
flop of J-4s-2s. I'm up against top set and middle set but the turn is
an Ace making me a straight and the river non-repeat spade still keeps
me a winner. My stack has hit \$2670, up \$1750 from my \$920 in
buyins.

I then lose way too much on a ``flopped top two'' flop which was a
very vulnerable hand and not really a big pot hand, especially when my
top two pair were 63 on a 632 flop. The runout 63289 sees an all in
player triple up with 98 and another player beat me with 86. Crappy
top two pair should be ditched in big pots.

Next I lose big with A-6-5s-4s on an A-As-3s flop. I'm up against the
King-high spades draw and I don't fill up and the flush gets there on
the runout A-As-3s-7s-Q. Ouch.

With my stack back down to 1345 I stupidly give a full \$550 away to
someone who turned a full house. I've got Ah-8h-4h-3 and the flop is
Kh-9-4h. Calling \$350 on the flop was OK, but when the board pairs
the 4 I stupidly call another \$550 from an all-in player who of
course had flopped a set and has now filled up 99944. He's jammed
every street and although I have a miracle final four in the deck out
I don't get it and I didn't deserve to.

Well below par with just 345 now, I take a preflop chance with KKxy,
running it into AAxy and a third player's double suited hand scoops
when he turns a flush. Time to reach into my wallet a fourth time.

My position is now 300 chips, 4400 in my wallet and par is 1220.
After a \$25 miss, I then win a crazy 6x party pot; which I win with
just two pair using A7. I'm now up to \$1800, happy days. I give
a fair bit back holding K-7-6-6 on a Q77 flop; not much chance against
Q7. Back to 850 now. I get my stack back to \$1500 when the next huge
hand occurs.

The player on my immediate left is a crazy Russian named Pav. He
overvalues non-nut flushes a lot and when I turn a nut flush, I'm able
to check-raise his \$400 bet to \$1300. He sets me all in for a few
hundred dollars more and his Queen high flush was no chance.

This takes my stack to \$3200 and my stack then goes into a holding
pattern for the next forty minutes. I'm winning \$300 pots every five
pots or so but losing \$40 to \$120 in some other pots in the
meantime. Here's a progression of my stack size at various times:
3240, 2955, 2825, 2700, 2570, 2495, 2775, 3005, 2810, 3700 (nut flush
in a very big pot), 3545, 3600, 3445. It's now 1:40am and my stack has
been in the 2700-3400 range for about an hour; without much risk of
losing it all but also without much chance of a big 1000 increase
either. It's looking like a nice 2,000 winning night for me, give or
take a few hundred. There's not much happening, maybe I should just
call it a night. But I push on.

\subsection*{Pushing on}

Two hands against Asian Jack are about to send my stack into the
stratosphere. In the first hand I've got A-A-x-y on a Q84 flop. I
check-call a decent bet and an Ace comes on the turn. I get in a
check-raise of the full pot to \$1,070 and get a call. The river is
a 6 and I check, intending to call any bet but Jack checks behind. I
should have put in a crying bet (maybe he had a lower set that just
wouldn't have been able to fold). I now have \$4700, my biggest stack
for the night so far. And the biggest hand of my life is just around
the corner.

I've got Q-Q-Js-Ts, good enough to hang around in a big reraised pot
and looking fantastic on a flop of Qs-4d-2d. Jack fires \$425 into the
\$455 pot, I flat call and a third player calls behind. I'm hoping for
a non-Diamond high card on the turn; that doesn't complete Diamond
flushes or low straight wraps. The turn is the Ks and Jack blasts full
pot of \$1730 from first position.

I'm a bit worried Jack might have hit a higher set on the turn, but I
now have up and down and flat call. The third player thinks for a
while about calling as well, although \$1730 is a massive bet and if
I'm calling then any non-nut draws he has are probably dead to my
draws. About thirty seconds after I've made my call I realise that
not only was I up and down with KQJT on the turn, I'm up and down
straight flush, with Ks-Qs-Js-Ts. The third player ends up folding and
we're heads up to the river with a meaningful pot of \$5,190.

The river is the As and I end up making a Royal Flush! Jack, who has
been pounding at this pot on every street including preflop, finally
checks. ``I'm all-in'' I say but Jack folds pretty quickly. I'm not
going to take this hand to my grave so I show the table my Royal Flush
and also the set of Queens that I'd flopped. Jack said he'd been
bluffing the whole way; but maybe he had a lower set or was
bet-bluffing a diamond draw or low straight wrap.

I should have raised on the turn and won another \$1300 or so. Second
set with up and down straight flush draw is strong enough to take to
war. I'd have looked like a genius if the third player had called the
turn as well, but the bet was so huge that the third player was often
going to fold there, and once Jack missed on the river I couldn't get
more money out of him; maybe I should have charged a ``lookup fee'' of
\$200 into the \$5000 pot and given him the chance to
bluff-check-raise the rest of my chips.

The finish to this session shows the positive effects of pushing on.
In October I'd pushed on and turned what could've been a \$3200 win
into a \$1500 loss, a \$4700 downswing. But in November I've pushed on
and turned what could've been a \$2000 win into a \$6700 win, a \$4700
upswing.

Seven thousand in Seven hours. This deserves not three cheers, but
seven Send its. Send it, Send it, Send it, Send it, Send it, Send it,
