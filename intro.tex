\chapter{Introduction}

My previous Lessons From Sessions Special Report small book was
called Ten Thousand in Ten Weeks. I loved the title of that
report and of course the dollars won over that period.
This report has an even more exciting and attention-grabbing title: Seven
Thousand in Seven Hours. It tells the story of my most recent big
poker session, which was the biggest win of my life. Seven thousand dollars
in Seven Hours.

I'm stretching the truth ever so slightly in my title. The session was
a touch over Seven Hours, it went from 7:10pm until 2:25am so it's
seven-and-a-quarter hours. And my winnings didn't quite hit \$7000, in
fact I ended \$6700 to the good. That's 95.7\% of \$7000 so close enough
for the title. Seven Thousand in Seven Hours sounds much better as a
report title than ``a bit under seven thousand in a bit over seven
hours''.

The session was at Canberra Casino, of course. It was the first winning
session of my Summer 2019 Campaign. Before we get to the huge win, I
need to write about the bad start to that campaign and a Sunday night
life episode that I wish had never happened. But first, an update on
my attempts to get my ban at The Star lifted.

\section*{Still banned from Star}

I sat through Star's third-party psychological assessment; they
reported to Star and I'm still banned. I can reapply in another 12 months,
which is October 2020. Barangaroo will be close to opening by then.

The psych assessment was like a very bad job interview; I sat in a
boardroom getting asked personal questions from an uncaring
professional woman who looked like she had a lot more issues than I've
ever had. She actually said at the end of the interview that food
delivery companies like UberEats and Deliveroo are causing great
damage to Australia by helping depressed people overeat and order too
much takeaway food with too much convenience.

The psych woman didn't understand advantage gambling. I brought along
the Doctor Straight Bluff magazine article and an Australian Poker
Weekly to support my readmission story which was:

\textit{I banned myself in 2005 after early problems with gambling.
With the pub poker explosion I then got to play lots of poker and
get good at the game. Look at this 2006 magazine article of me winning
a tournament and look at this 2011 article of mine in Australian Poker
Weekly. I recently won big PLO sit and gos at Petersham RSL and I
enjoy playing pub games there, at Rounders, and cashies here and
there. By the way I play regularly at other Casinos in Australia
including Canberra and Crown.}

Pride comes before a fall, and I would have done better being more
humble and not trying to tell the psych lady that I'm good at gambling
these days. In a job interview, a question you expect to be
asked is ``where do you see yourself five years from now?''. In the
psych assessment interview, the killer question (which I should have
been prepared for) is ``why do you want to go back and gamble at The
Star?''.

I was so pissed off about Star's decision that I considered for a few
days contacting all of my Lessons from Sessions readers and getting
them to write references for me to the Star guy (who is the amusingly
named Mr Wagemans) as part of a support campaign. I didn't go through
with that idea and I remain banned from Star; so Canberra will see a
lot of me in coming months. Barangaroo should be up and going in
2020 so I'll soon have Sydney Casino poker action no matter how much
Star dick me around.

Yul Brynner made powerful anti-smoking ads at the end of his life, saying
``Don't smoke. Whatever you do, don't smoke.'' In the same spirit, let
me advise you all ``Don't ban yourself from a Casino. Whatever you
do, don't ban yourself from a Casino''. The readmissions process is a
nightmare.
