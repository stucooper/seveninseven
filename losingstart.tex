\chapter{A Losing Start}

At the end of Ten Thousand in Ten Weeks, I anounced the start of my
Summer 2019 campaign, lasting until 31st December 2019. I set myself a
target of \$8000 profit in eleven weeks; which is \$728 a week or just
over \$100 a day. The campaign started terribly and by week four I had
four losses in a row and was down \$2500! I was on track for a ten
thousand dollar \textbf{loss} in ten weeks, giving back my entire
winnings from the Spring Campaign.

\section*{The Sunday Night Life Episode}

I wrote my car off by running up the back of another car on King
George's Road in Beverly Hills on Sunday night 3rd November 2019.
I was rushing from a home game in Sylvania to pick up my girlfriend in
Parramatta; it was pouring rain and a Deliveroo motorbike
rider dickhead (are there any other kind?) had pulled out without
looking, causing a right lane guy to hit him and stop dead and causing
me to run up the back of the right lane guy. Yes I was driving too
fast for the conditions and yes I was at fault but the cops didn't
issue any tickets and I settled with the other car driver.

I'd only been at the Sylvania Home Game for five minutes; it was a
game I'd been invited to many times and I felt I should ``put in an
appearance'' even though I knew I'd have to leave it by 930pm to get
to Parramatta by 10pm. There's no point turning up to a poker game for
five minutes and expecting even hoping to lose a single buyin; it's
actually extremely rude and you're better off not turning up at all.

You don't know how much you use your car and need your car until you
haven't got one. Being without a car is extremely annoying; both from
a shopping, social and and poker point of view. Just about the only
event I was easily able to get to from my place in Carlingford by
public transport was a Saturday raceday at Rosehill Gardens.

My car was on its last legs and I was going to get a new car in March
2020 once the rego on the old car had expired. I'm now bringing
forward those plans by a few months.
