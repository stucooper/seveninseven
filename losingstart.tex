\chapter{A Losing Start}

At the end of Ten Thousand in Ten Weeks, I anounced the start of my
Summer 2019 campaign, lasting until 31st December 2019. I set myself a
target of \$8000 profit in eleven weeks; which is \$728 a week or just
over \$100 a day. The campaign started terribly and by week four I had
four losses in a row and was down \$2300! I was on track for a ten
thousand dollar \textbf{loss} in eleven weeks, giving back my entire
winnings from the Spring Campaign.

\section*{A big Canberra loss}

The Campaign started with a trip to Casino Canberra on Friday 25th
October. Canberra have dropped their old 1-2-5 \$200-\$UNLIMITED buyin
game, and the PLO big game there is now 5-5 \$200-\$2,000 buyin. I
liked the 1-2-5 format although the unlimited buyin did let some
megarich maniacs simply rebuy and cover the table when they lost their
stacks. \$2000 should be enough to play with in a game with the big
blind of \$5.

My first buyin of \$200 goes well early, getting to \$1,300. I then
suffer a turned nut straight losing to a board pair on the river. I'm
then made to call big bets on the flop and turn with a nut flush draw,
but it misses and I'm back to \$230 then busted soon after. My second
buyin doesn't last and the third buyin gets annoyingly unlucky. I've
got A-J-5-5 to a flop of 755. I get all in against K-Q-Q-5 who spikes
a Queen on the turn to leave me drawing dead. He only had four outs
when the money went in but I can't blame him for jamming his money in
against my hand.

I'm soon in for my fourth buyin, which is the most interesting buyin
of the night. I get my stack up to \$1980 with a few winning hands and
then win a megapot against Maths David. I hold Q-T-9-9 and flop the
straight world on a flop of K-Jc-8c. Maths David has Kc-K-Tc-4 for the
top set and good flush draw but I crack him on the runout KJ8TA; no
clubs and no repeaters. A nice break for me; because top set flush
draw is always a favourite.

My stack is now a huge \$4,080 and although I'm into my fourth buyin
and in for \$800 I'm looking at a massive \$3,200 win, if I cash out
now. Unfortunately, I push on.

\subsection*{Pushing on}

One aspect of Poker I am \textbf{obsessed} with is the Leaving
Decision. You haven't made your profit until you cash your chips in,
put those beautiful winnings in your pocket, and exit the Casino.
If you've made a long trip to a poker game, as I do for my Canberra
games, it seems even harder to leave. You've driven for hours to get a
poker fix, you've got a ton of chips in front of you, and it's still
before midnight. It seems too early to leave.

So I push on, and it's now my turn to get my top set of Kings
cracked. I've got KK on a K-4s-2s board and I check raise the Asian
Maniac Lok all-in. He's got the nut flush draw; a spade comes on the
turn and the river is not a board pair and in just this one hand my
stack has gone from \$4,080 to \$1,710. A full double up for Lok. I'm
technically still ahead but it sure doesn't feel like it anymore and
you can imagine how this story ends.

I get my stack back to \$2580, now a nicely \$1700 up. It looks
unlikely I'll get back to the \$4000 heights but I should still be
able to take a \$1500-\$2000 win if I keep my head. I then lose a full
\$1000 on a very strange cracked Aces hand.

I've got A-Ah-J-4h and the flop is good enough to continue being
Jh-7-4. I've got top and bottom and the turn brings me a flush draw,
the board now reading Jh-7-4-Th. I bet \$300 but I get called. The
river repeats the board but does bring me my flush, it's the 7h. I
crying call a \$600 river bet, to be shown pocket Tens. What a
horrible turn card for me, and what a miracle runout for the winner.

I'm now on tilt and a few more buyins disappear at great speed and
soon my entire \$1735 has gone and I've exercised my \$1000 ATM
withdrawal. I do make a tiny bit of my money back, cashing out for
\$1270; but I've taken a \$1465 loss for tonight, which I will call
\$1500 for maths convenience elsewhere in this book.

I could've taken a \$3200 win, instead I've taken a \$1500 loss;
that's a \$4700 downswing. A very bad start to the Summer 2019 Campaign.

\section*{The Sunday Night Life Episode}

I wrote my car off by running up the back of another car on King
George's Road in Beverly Hills on Sunday night 3rd November 2019.
I was rushing from a home game in Sylvania to pick up my girlfriend in
Parramatta; it was pouring rain and a Deliveroo motorbike
rider dickhead (are there any other kind?) had pulled out without
looking, causing a right lane guy to hit him and stop dead and causing
me to run up the back of the right lane guy. Yes I was driving too
fast for the conditions and yes I was at fault but the cops didn't
issue any tickets and I settled with the other car driver.

I'd only been at the Sylvania Home Game for five minutes; it was a
game I'd been invited to many times and I felt I should ``put in an
appearance'' even though I knew I'd have to leave it by 930pm to get
to Parramatta by 10pm. There's no point turning up to a poker game for
five minutes and expecting even hoping to lose a single buyin; it's
actually extremely rude and you're better off not turning up at all.

You don't know how much you use your car and need your car until you
haven't got one. Being without a car is extremely annoying; both from
a shopping, social and and poker point of view. Just about the only
event I was easily able to get to from my place in Carlingford by
public transport was a Saturday raceday at Rosehill Gardens.

My car was on its last legs and I was going to get a new car in March
2020 once the rego on the old car had expired. I'm now bringing
forward those plans by a few months.

Before I was just losing at poker, now I'm losing at life.

\section*{Other losses}

The big Canberra loss obviously dominates the other losses which are
\$200 on the Car Smash night and Tournament losses; a third (bubble
finish) at the Petersham \$250 Sit and Go PLO, a \$120 loss again at
Petersham (the PLO didn't get up that night so I lost at PLO) and a
small loss at Lakes. The losses do add up, and before we get to
the huge Canberra win the Summer 2019 Campaign looks like this.
